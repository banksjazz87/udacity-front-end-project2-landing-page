# Landing Page
This is a landing page that I have created for the Udacity front-end developer program.
There are number a few features that you can look for, as you look at the page.
If you are actually interested in purchasing anything on the landing page,
all of the links work and you can be directed to an active website to purchase the item.

## Features
* Use of a 'hamburger' dropdown menu in the navBar.
* Smooth scrolling feature as you click on a page navigation link.
* Active states, both while hovering and clicking on items, the section elements are responsive.
* After initially scrolling and then more than 2 seconds of inactivity, the navigation bar disappears.

### Summary
Enjoy this landing page, and if you have any thoughts or concerns on how to make it bettter,
shoot me a pull request.
